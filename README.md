# Telecom_Churn_Prediction

## About This Project

Churn poses a significant challenge in the telecom industry.  Average monthly churn rate among the leading three wireless carriers(Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, O2) in Germany ranges from 0.7% to 2% according to Statista. To address this issue, I conducted a  exploratory data analysis on churn in the telecom sector and employed predictive analytics to identify potential churn customers.

During the analysis, I assessed various classification techniques, evaluating their accuracy along with metrics like ROC-AUC score, True Positive Rate, and False Positive Rate.
